# COVID-19-and-Random-Forest-classification
Random forests reduce the high variance of Decision Tree algorithms to produce a more robust model and still possess some of the benefits of trees, such as the ability to handle numerical and categorical variables, good handling of outliers and dealing with variables that are highly correlated.  The goal of this model is to accurately fit COVID-19 data from South Korea found on Kaggle and determine some of the most important features in the data that determine the "state" of the patient.  There are quite a few missing values so different imputation methods will be used to eliminate them.  One-hot encoding and scaling will be performed before the model is trained on the training data.  A normalized confusion matrix will be developed before feature importances are plotted.
